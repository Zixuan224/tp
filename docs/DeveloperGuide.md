## **Acknowledgements**

* This project is based on the [AddressBook-Level3 (AB3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org). The overall architecture, component structure (UI, Logic, Model, Storage), and base documentation were adapted from AB3.
* The undo feature design was inspired by the proposed undo/redo implementation described in the [AB3 Developer Guide](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html). Our implementation differs in that it uses per-command state capture rather than the VersionedAddressBook (full snapshot) approach.
* The `CopyCommand` uses the Java AWT `Clipboard` API (`java.awt.Toolkit`) to interface with the operating system clipboard.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `contact delete 1`.
<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ViewPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("contact delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `contact delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteContactCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteContactCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteContactCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve. 
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`. 
5. If the command implements the `UndoableCommand` interface, `LogicManager` pushes it onto the `commandHistory` stack so it can be reversed by a subsequent `undo` command.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g., during testing.
### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Copy Command Feature
The `copy` command allows users to quickly serialize a specific contact's complex profile (including their name, games, and aliases) into a perfectly formatted, executable CLI string (e.g., `contact add n/John Doe g/Valorant...`) and saves it directly to their operating system's clipboard.

#### Architecture and Execution
To avoid cluttering the main logic architecture diagram, the structural relationship of the `CopyCommand` is shown in the feature-specific class diagram below.

![CopyCommandClassDiagram](images/CopyCommandClassDiagram.png)

The command execution heavily relies on the `Logic` and `Model` components to retrieve the target contact, format the string, and then interfaces with the external OS `Clipboard`.

Step-by-step execution:
1. The user launches the application and inputs `copy 1` into the `CommandBox`.
2. `LogicManager` passes the input to `AddressBookParser`, which maps the command word to the `CopyCommandParser`.
3. `CopyCommandParser` parses the index, creates a `CopyCommand` object, and returns it.
4. `LogicManager` calls `CopyCommand#execute(model)`.
5. The command fetches the target `Person` from the `Model` using the provided index.
6. The command formats the person's attributes into a valid CLI string.
7. The command fetches the system `Clipboard` and sets its content to the formatted string.
8. A `CommandResult` is returned to indicate success.

The following sequence diagram illustrates this interaction:

![CopySequenceDiagram](images/CopySequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:
* **Alternative 1 (Current):** Interface directly with the `Clipboard` within the `CopyCommand` execution logic, but use a mock/stub clipboard for testing.
    * **Pros:** Keeps the command highly cohesive and straightforward.
    * **Cons:** Requires careful testing setup to ensure CI/CD pipelines (which run in headless Linux environments without physical clipboards) do not crash with `IllegalStateException`.
* **Alternative 2:** Have the `CopyCommand` return the generated string inside the `CommandResult`, and force the `MainWindow` (UI) to push it to the clipboard.
    * **Pros:** Avoids headless testing issues entirely since the Logic component never touches the OS.
    * **Cons:** Violates the separation of concerns. The UI should merely display results, not execute system-level operations meant to be triggered by a specific command.

---

### Command History Navigation (Up/Down Arrows)
To improve the Quality of Life (QoL) of the CLI interface, users can navigate their session's command history using the Up and Down arrow keys.

#### Architecture and Execution
The command history state is managed directly within the `CommandBox` UI component. Because the history is only relevant to the current user session and involves direct manipulation of the JavaFX text field and caret position, a lightweight, self-contained implementation was chosen to minimize unnecessary dependencies between the UI and Logic components.

The state is tracked using two internal variables:
* `commandHistory`: An `ArrayList` storing the string values of previously executed commands.
* `historyPointer`: An integer tracking the user's current index during navigation.

Step-by-step execution for navigating backwards:
1. The user presses the Up arrow key while focused on the text field.
2. The `CommandBox` captures the event via its `handleKeyPress(KeyEvent)` listener.
3. The component checks if the `historyPointer` is greater than 0. If so, it decrements the pointer.
4. The `setCommandTextFromHistory()` method retrieves the string from the `commandHistory` list at the new pointer index.
5. The text field is updated, and the cursor (`caret`) is forcefully positioned at the end of the loaded string so the user can immediately begin typing.
6. The `KeyEvent` is consumed to prevent the default JavaFX behavior (which would move the caret back to the beginning of the text).

![CommandHistorySequenceDiagram](images/CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
* **Integrated UI State vs. Logic Component:** While moving history tracking to the `Logic` package would decouple the data, keeping it inside `CommandBox` drastically simplifies the architecture. The history list and pointer are inherently tied to UI-specific actions (JavaFX `KeyEvent` handling, text property listeners, and caret manipulation). Furthermore, since the history does not need to persist across app launches (it is session-only), implementing a simple `ArrayList` within the UI layer avoids over-engineering the application's core Logic API.

### Editing a contact's name feature

The `contact edit` command allows users to rename an existing contact while preserving all associated games and aliases. It is implemented via `EditContactCommand`, parsed by `EditContactCommandParser`, and routed through `ContactCommandParser`.

#### Architecture and Execution

**Parsing flow:**
1. `AddressBookParser` receives `"contact edit 1 e/Jan"` (or `"contact edit n/Janelle e/Jan"`) and dispatches to `ContactCommandParser`.
2. `ContactCommandParser` splits on the first token (`"edit"`) and delegates the remaining args to `EditContactCommandParser`.
3. `EditContactCommandParser` tokenizes using `PREFIX_NAME` (`n/`) and `PREFIX_NEW_NAME` (`e/`). It then determines the target via `ParserUtil.verifyIndexOrNamePresent` — either an index from the preamble, a name from `n/`, or `0` for the user profile — and returns an `EditContactCommand(targetIndex, targetName, newName, useUserProfile)`.

**Execution flow:**
1. `EditContactCommand#execute()` resolves the target `Person`:
   * If `useUserProfile` is true, retrieves the user profile via `model.getUserProfile()`.
   * If `targetIndex` is set, retrieves the person at that index from the filtered list.
   * If `targetName` is set, searches `model.getFilteredPersonList()` for a case-insensitive name match.
2. If not found, a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_PERSON_NOT_FOUND` is thrown.
3. A new `Person` is created with `newName` and the original person's `games`, and `isUserProfile` flag.
4. If the new name already belongs to a different person, a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON` is thrown.
5. `model.setPerson()` replaces the old entry, and the filtered list is reset to show all persons.
6. A `CommandResult` is returned, displaying the updated contact.

#### Design Considerations

* **Immutable `Person` model** — `Person` objects are immutable; editing creates a new `Person` rather than mutating the existing one. This keeps the model simple and consistent with the rest of the codebase.
* **Index and name-based lookup** — The command supports both index and name identification, consistent with `alias edit` and `view`. A single constructor `(Index, Name, Name, boolean)` is used with the unused field passed as `null`, matching the pattern used by `EditAliasCommand`.
* **Games and aliases preserved** — The new `Person` is constructed with the original person's `games` map, so all associated data is retained after a rename.

---

### Delete Confirmation Feature
The `contact delete`, `game delete`, and `alias delete` commands require a y/n confirmation from the user before deletion is applied, to prevent accidental data loss.

#### Architecture and Execution
The structural relationship of the delete commands is shown in the class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCommandClassDiagram.puml" alt="Delete Command Class Diagram" />

All three delete commands implement `ConfirmableDeleteCommand`, which declares `performDeletion()` and `getCancelMessage()`. This gives `LogicManager` a single unified code path for all confirmation handling.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the two-step flow for `contact delete n/Alice` followed by `y`:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteConfirmSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Delete Confirmation Sequence Diagram" />

Step-by-step execution:
1. The user inputs `contact delete n/Alice`.
2. `LogicManager` passes the input to `AddressBookParser`, which creates a `DeleteContactCommand`.
3. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteContactCommand#execute(model)`, which finds the target but does **not** delete yet — returns a `CommandResult` with `isAwaitingConfirmation = true`.
4. `LogicManager` stores the command in `pendingConfirmableCommand` and shows the confirmation prompt.
5. The user inputs `y` — `LogicManager#handleDeleteConfirmation()` calls `performDeletion()` on the command, conditionally pushes it to `commandHistory` if it implements `UndoableCommand`, and saves the address book.
6. If the user inputs `n` or any other input, `getCancelMessage()` is returned and the model is unchanged.

#### Design Considerations:
* **`ConfirmableDeleteCommand` is decoupled from `UndoableCommand`** — allows future commands to require confirmation without needing to support undo. All three current delete commands implement both interfaces explicitly.
* **Alternative:** Have `LogicManager` perform the deletion directly (e.g. `model.deletePerson()`) after confirmation, without a `performDeletion()` method on the command.
    * **Pros:** Simpler — no extra interface or method needed.
    * **Cons:** `LogicManager` must know the internals of each delete command (e.g. which game or alias to remove), violating separation of concerns and requiring `instanceof` checks for each command type.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** `ClearCommand` also requires a y/n confirmation before proceeding, but it does **not** implement `ConfirmableDeleteCommand`. Instead, it uses its own `executeConfirmed(Model model)` method, triggered by a separate `awaitingClearConfirmation` flag in `CommandResult` that `LogicManager` checks. This is because `ConfirmableDeleteCommand` is designed around commands that identify a specific target before asking for confirmation. `ClearCommand` has no such target resolution step — it unconditionally clears all contacts — so it does not fit the interface's contract.

</box>

---

### Undo feature

The undo mechanism is implemented using a **command history stack** managed by `LogicManager`, together with an `UndoableCommand` interface that undoable commands implement.

#### Architecture and Execution

**Key classes involved:**

* `UndoableCommand` (interface) — declares `void undo(Model model)`, which each undoable command implements to reverse its own effect.
* `UndoCommand` — pops the most recent command from the history stack and calls its `undo()` method.
* `LogicManager` — owns the history stack (`Deque<UndoableCommand> commandHistory`) and pushes commands onto it after successful execution.

**How the history stack is maintained:**

After a command executes successfully, `LogicManager` checks whether it implements `UndoableCommand`. If it does, the command is pushed onto the `commandHistory` deque (used as a LIFO stack). Read-only commands (e.g. `list`, `find`) do not implement `UndoableCommand` and are never added to history.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** `UndoCommand` itself is not pushed to history — it is created directly in `LogicManager` when the keyword `undo` is detected, bypassing the parser.

</box>

**How each command reverses itself (per-command state capture):**

Rather than saving a full snapshot of the address book after each command, each undoable command captures only what it needs:

| Command | State captured | Undo action |
|---|---|---|
| `AddContactCommand` | The `Person` added | `model.deletePerson(toAdd)` |
| `DeleteContactCommand` | The `Person` deleted (set after confirmation) | `model.addPerson(deletedPerson)` |
| `ClearCommand` | Full `AddressBook` snapshot (before clear) | `model.setAddressBook(previousAddressBook)` |
| `AddGameCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |
| `DeleteGameCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |
| `AddAliasCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |
| `DeleteAliasCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |
| `EditContactCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |
| `EditAliasCommand` | `personBeforeEdit`, `personAfterEdit` | `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)` |

**Special case — delete confirmation:**

As described in the previous section, confirmable commands (`DeleteContactCommand`, `DeleteGameCommand`, `DeleteAliasCommand`) are only pushed to `commandHistory` after the user confirms with `y`/`yes`. Cancelling the deletion means nothing is added to history.

Given below is an example usage scenario showing how the undo mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The user executes `contact add n/David` to add a new contact. `AddContactCommand` executes, stores the added `Person`, and is pushed onto `commandHistory`.

Step 2. The user executes `game add n/David g/Chess` to add a game. `AddGameCommand` executes, stores `personBeforeEdit` and `personAfterEdit`, and is pushed onto `commandHistory`.

Step 3. The user executes `undo`. `LogicManager` creates `UndoCommand(commandHistory)`. It pops `AddGameCommand` from the stack and calls its `undo()`, which calls `model.setPerson(personAfterEdit, personBeforeEdit)`, restoring David's original state.

Step 4. The user executes `undo` again. `UndoCommand` pops `AddContactCommand` and calls its `undo()`, which calls `model.deletePerson(toAdd)`, removing David entirely.

Step 5. The user executes `undo` again. The history stack is empty, so `UndoCommand` throws a `CommandException` with the message `"Error: Nothing to undo."`

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation flows through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Current choice:** Per-command state capture — each command stores only the data it needs to reverse itself.
  * Pros: Low memory overhead; no full address book snapshots needed for most commands.
  * Cons: Every new undoable command must correctly implement `undo()`.

* **Alternative:** Save a full address book snapshot after every command (VersionedAddressBook approach).
  * Pros: Simpler to implement per command — no per-command state logic needed.
  * Cons: Higher memory usage, especially with large contact lists.

**Aspect: No redo support:**

Redo is not implemented. Once a command is undone it is removed from the history stack permanently.

---

### Theme Switching Feature

The `theme` command allows users to switch the application's visual appearance between `light`, `dark`, and `rainbow` themes at runtime.

#### Architecture and Execution

Theme switching is notable because it involves **UI-side effects triggered from the Logic layer** — `ThemeCommand` does not modify the `Model`, but instead signals `MainWindow` to swap CSS stylesheets by embedding the chosen theme string inside the `CommandResult`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow for `theme light`:

<puml src="diagrams/ThemeSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Theme Sequence Diagram" />

Step-by-step execution:
1. The user inputs `theme light` (or `theme dark` / `theme rainbow`).
2. `AddressBookParser` routes the command to `ThemeCommandParser`, which creates a `ThemeCommand("light")`.
3. `ThemeCommand#execute()` validates the parameter against the accepted values (`light`, `dark`, `rainbow`) and returns a `CommandResult` carrying the theme string via `CommandResult(msg, "light")`.
4. Back in `MainWindow#executeCommand()`, after receiving the result, it checks `commandResult.getThemeToSwitch()`.
5. If non-null, `MainWindow#handleThemeSwitch(String theme)` is called, which swaps the active CSS stylesheets on the scene dynamically.

#### Design Considerations:
* **Theme string carried in `CommandResult`** — `ThemeCommand` places the theme value inside `CommandResult` rather than calling the UI directly. This keeps `ThemeCommand` within the Logic layer and prevents a downward dependency from Logic onto UI.
* **Alternative:** Have `ThemeCommand` interact with the UI directly (e.g. via a callback or static reference to `MainWindow`).
    * **Pros:** No changes needed to `CommandResult`.
    * **Cons:** Creates an illegal dependency from Logic to UI, violating the architecture's layered design.

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Initial startup should take no longer than 2 seconds.
2. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
3. The app is intended for a **single user** — it does not support concurrent access or multiple user accounts.
4. All contact data should **persist between sessions** — data is saved automatically after every command and restored on the next launch.
5. The app should work on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** with Java 17 or above installed.
6. The app should function **fully offline** — no internet connection is required for any feature.

### Glossary

* **Alias**: An alternate in-game username used by a contact for a specific game
* **Contact**: A person stored in Harmony's contact list, identified by a unique name
* **Game**: A game title associated with a contact, under which aliases are grouped
* **User Profile**: A special contact representing the user themselves, accessible via the `me` keyword
* **Index**: The position number of a contact in the currently displayed list, starting from 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Make the command result window scale with text.** The current command result window is too small to fully view the result of the command. This might prevent users from viewing the full result without breaking from "full CLI". We plan to make the result display area dynamically resize based on the length of the output text.

2. **Make the Contact List panel scrollable without mouse input.** The current Contact List panel can only be scrolled with a mouse (barring the `find` command to reduce the list size), breaking from "full CLI". We plan to add keyboard shortcuts (e.g. `Ctrl+Up`/`Ctrl+Down`) to scroll through the contact list without a mouse.

3. **Improve component scaling when the application window is resized.** Currently, resizing the application window only widens the command result area while the bottom view panels do not scale proportionally, which does not translate well on larger screens. We plan to update the layout so all panels scale proportionally with the window size.

4. **Accept hyphens and apostrophes in contact names.** The current name validation only accepts alphanumeric characters and spaces, rejecting real-world names such as `Mary-Jane` or `O'Brien`. We plan to extend the name validation regex to also permit hyphens (`-`) and apostrophes (`'`), so that `contact add n/Mary-Jane` and `contact add n/O'Brien` are accepted.

5. **Restate the contact name in the deletion confirmation prompt.** Currently, after triggering a deletion (e.g. `contact delete 1`), if the user scrolls away from the confirmation message, there is no reminder of which contact is about to be deleted when they type `y`. We plan to repeat the contact's name in the confirmation prompt so it is always visible, e.g. `Confirm deletion of Alex Yeoh? (y/n)`.

6. **Make the UI reflect the state before and after an undo.** Currently the `undo` command updates the model but the UI only refreshes to show the new state without visually indicating what changed. We plan to highlight the affected contact in the list after an undo so the user can clearly see what was reversed.

7. **Add the ability to edit a game name.** Currently, games can only be added, deleted, and listed. If a game name is entered incorrectly, the user must delete and re-add it, losing all associated aliases in the process. We plan to add a `game edit` command (e.g. `game edit 1 g/OldGame e/NewGame`) that renames the game while preserving its aliases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Effort**

**Difficulty level:** Significantly higher than AB3.

**Effort relative to AB3:** We estimate the overall effort at approximately 2× that of AB3, based on the increased complexity of the data model, the number of new features, and the non-trivial cross-feature interactions introduced.

**Key challenges and achievements:**

* **Multiple interconnected entity types.** AB3 manages a single entity type (`Person`) with flat fields (name, phone, email, address, tags). Harmony manages a three-level hierarchy: `Person` → `Game` → `Alias`. Every command that touches games or aliases must navigate this nesting, handle the immutable `Person` model by reconstructing the full object, and propagate changes upward through the hierarchy. This significantly increased the complexity of every game and alias command compared to an equivalent AB3 command.

* **Custom two-tier command syntax.** AB3 uses simple single-word commands (e.g. `add`, `delete`). Harmony introduces a namespaced command structure (`contact add`, `game delete`, `alias edit`) requiring a two-level parser architecture (`AddressBookParser` → `ContactCommandParser`/`GameCommandParser`/`AliasCommandParser`). Designing and testing this routing layer was a non-trivial addition.

* **Undo mechanism.** AB3 does not implement undo. We built a per-command state capture approach where each undoable command stores only the minimal state needed to reverse itself (e.g. `personBeforeEdit`/`personAfterEdit`). This required careful design of the `UndoableCommand` interface and integration with `LogicManager`'s history stack across all modifying commands.

* **Delete confirmation flow.** AB3 deletes immediately on command. We added a two-step confirmation flow (`ConfirmableDeleteCommand` interface + `pendingConfirmableCommand` in `LogicManager`) that required coordinating state across command executions without breaking the existing architecture.

* **Clipboard integration and headless testing.** The `CopyCommand` interfaces directly with the OS clipboard via `java.awt.Toolkit`, which required solving a non-trivial CI/CD problem: headless Linux environments used in GitHub Actions do not expose a physical clipboard, causing `IllegalStateException`. This required a mock/stub clipboard setup for tests.

* **Theme switching.** Implementing runtime CSS theme switching (light/dark/rainbow) required a clean signal path from the Logic layer to the UI without violating the architecture's layer boundaries. This was solved by embedding the theme string in `CommandResult` and having `MainWindow` act on it.

**Effort saved through reuse:**

The overall component structure (UI, Logic, Model, Storage), the JSON storage mechanism, and the JavaFX layout scaffolding were adapted from AB3 with modifications, saving significant boilerplate work. The base parser infrastructure (`ArgumentTokenizer`, `ArgumentMultimap`, `CliSyntax`) was reused with extensions for new prefixes (`g/`, `al/`, `e/`).
